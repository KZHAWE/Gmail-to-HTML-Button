# Gmail-to-HTML-Button
Switches Gmail from its normal version to HTML with the click of a button!

Hi there, and thanks for using my extension! To use, simply open Gmail or any new tab, click on the extension, and then click on the button!

Note: This sets to u/1, meaning your default Google account. If you are signed in on your secondary account, this will not work. 
To change this, go to popup.js and change the line chrome.tabs.update({ url: 'https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=html' });. 
Change u/0 to u/1, u/2, or whatever you want.

If you have any issues, please don't hesitate to ask!
